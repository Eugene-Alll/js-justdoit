// Scaffolding (coping from bootstrap scaffolding with some changes)
// --------------------------------------------------


// Reset the box-sizing
//
// Heads up! This reset may cause conflicts with some third-party widgets.
// For recommendations on resolving such conflicts, see
// http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#third-box-sizing
* {
  @include box-sizing(border-box);
}
*:before,
*:after {
  @include box-sizing(border-box);
}

// Reset fonts for relevant elements
input,
button,
select,
textarea {
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: inherit;
  line-height: inherit;
}

// Links

a {
  text-decoration: none;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}

// Figures
//
// We reset this here because previously Normalize had no `figure` margins. This
// ensures we don't break anyone's use of the element.

figure {
  margin: 0;
}

// Images

img {
  vertical-align: middle;
}

// Responsive images (ensure images don't scale beyond their parents)
.img-responsive {
  @include img-responsive;
}

// iOS "clickable elements" fix for role="button"
//
// Fixes "clickability" issue (and more generally, the firing of events such as focus as well)
// for traditionally non-focusable elements with role="button"
// see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click#Safari_Mobile

[role="button"] {
  cursor: pointer;
}
